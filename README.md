# Bicorn Project

This project demonstrates a basic bicorn project. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. This project's goal is to show how random number generation can easily be done on the blockchain. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
